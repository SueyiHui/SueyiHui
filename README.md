### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on developing survival analysis for risk models to analyze time-to-event outcomes with different account states, facilitating the development of robust risk models and enabling more accurate prognostications future events.
- ðŸ¤© I previously worked on designing various **time-series regression models** and **statistical techniques such as Difference in Difference Method and Synthetic Control Method** to mimic the impacts of carbon tax policies using STATA, Python and R
- ðŸ¤– I worked on developing **deep learning models**, such as time series panel data prediction and image classification to support decision making in climate change using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**
- ðŸ’¬ I also worked on **Text Analysis & NLP Models** that could capture the addtional information via comments on house listings and hence conduct **real time pricing models in the real estate industry** previously
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **task-oriented chatbots trained from AI textbook** and had my **Tableau Desktop Specialist** certificate complete in December 2020
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **projects which can drive fast and efficient impact on business developing with apllication of Machine Learning and Deep Learning**
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with **opportunites that are data-analytics related**
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about  **anything ML & AI related**
- âš¡ Fun fact: Profile picture is my cat named **Meow** and liked to be tucked as a burrito
